# unjson

## Intro

A small utility to extract information from JSON files on the command line.

## Usage

Usage: unjson [-h] [-I] [-N] [key]/[index]/[-] [key]/[index]/[-] ...
  -h      Print this help and exit
  -I      Continue after key/index errors
  -N      Ignore null values
  [key]   Select only value of key of the object in current level
  [index] Select only the index of array in current level
  [-]     Go one level deeper
            (if not preceded by key or index will select
             all values of the current level)

Reads a JSON file from stdin and prints a string representation
of all selected elements. (if an element is complex (array or object)
it will be printed as JSON)

## Examples

Give a simple overview of issues of a github project
  curl "https://api.github.com/repos/USER/PROJECT/issues" | unjson - updated_at title | paste - - -d " | " | sort

Since there's nothing before "-" every element of the top-level object
(in this case: an array of issues) will be matchted. If you want for example
issue 1, 2, and 5 instead you can do:
  ... | unjson 1 2 5 ...
